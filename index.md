The aim of this tutorial is to provide participants an expedited opportunity to learn the basics of DUNE Computing.   A three half-day version  of this tutorial was offered in [May 2021](https://dune.github.io/computing-training-202112/) and may prove to be a reference. 

Here our schedule spans two parts, and advise your complete attention throughout.
