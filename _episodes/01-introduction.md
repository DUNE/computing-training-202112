## DUNE Computing Consortium

The goal of the DUNE Computing Consortium is to establish a global computing network that can handle the massive data dumps DUNE will produce by distributing them across the grid. It coordinates all DUNE computing activities and provides to new members the documentation and training to acquaint them with the specific and DUNE software and resources.

Coordinator: Heidi Schellman (Oregon State University)

## Support

There will be live documents linked from [Indico][indico-event-link] for each [Zoom][zoom-link] session. You can write questions there, anonymously or not, and experts will reply. The chat on Zoom can quickly saturate so this is a more convenient solution and proved very successful at the previous training. We will collect all questions and release a Q&A after the event.

You can join DUNE's Slack: `dunescience.slack.com`. We created a special channel `computing_training_may2021` for technical support, join [here][slack-join-link].
