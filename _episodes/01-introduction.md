## DUNE Computing Consortium

The goal of the DUNE Computing Consortium is to establish a global computing network that can handle the massive data dumps DUNE will produce by distributing them across the grid. It coordinates all DUNE computing activities and provides to new members the documentation and training to acquaint them with the specific and DUNE software and resources.

Coordinator: Heidi Schellman (Oregon State University)

## Opening Slides

The slides for the introduction of this tutorial can be found [here][intro-slides], or as a PDF on the [Indico site][computing-training-intro].

## Live Docs

Live (on-the-fly) documentation for the first and second portions of the tutorial can be found as:
- [Live document for the first tutorial session][live-doc-tutorial1]
- [Live document for the second tutorial session][live-doc-tutorial2]

## Support

There will be live documents linked from [Indico][indico-event-link] for each [Zoom][zoom-link] session. You can write questions there, anonymously or not, and experts will reply. The chat on Zoom can quickly saturate so this is a more convenient solution and proved very successful at the previous training. We will collect all questions and release a Q&A after the event.

You can join DUNE's Slack: `dunescience.slack.com`. We created a special [channel][slack-computing-training-doc2021] `computing_training_dec2021` for technical support, join [here][slack-join-link].
