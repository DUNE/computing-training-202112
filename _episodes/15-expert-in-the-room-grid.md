## Debug Session

This session of Expert in the Room is a Q&A. You bring content!
Write on the live doc your current error(s) and experts will provide guidance to participants in a live debug session.  
On top of learning why a job failed, we hope it will give you the tools to solve future issues by yourself. 


*Debugging is an art.*  


*Confusion is the sweat of learning.*
